# Neural-Network
Welcome to the Optimum MLP and CNN Models project! This repository contains code and resources for training and optimizing Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.

Overview
The Optimum MLP and CNN Models project focuses on training MLP and CNN models with optimized hyperparameters to achieve the best performance on various tasks, such as classification, regression, or any other suitable problem. By fine-tuning hyperparameters, we aim to find the optimal configuration for each model.

Features
Implementation of MLP and CNN architectures
Hyperparameter optimization for improved model performance
Efficient data preprocessing and augmentation techniques
Evaluation metrics for assessing model performance
Example scripts and notebooks for training and inference
Comprehensive documentation and usage guidelines
